This tool contains the Pasme transpiler and many utilities that aid in OS
development.

[Syntax]
pasme <orderType> [arguments/switches]

[Orders types]
Here are the possible orders you can use:

transpile <input>: Uses the Pasme transpiler to convert a <input> file into
  regular .asm
  -to <path>: Specifies a file to save the transpiled assembly
  -I  <folder>: Includes a folder in the transpiling process

assemble <input>: Invokes the assembler program to turn assembly into raw binary
  -to <path>: Where to save the binary code

burn <input>: Writes <input> file into another file, with configurable offsets
  and length. Primarily used to burn bootloaders.
  -to <path>: Destination file
  -srcOff <number>: Offset into the source file. By default is 0.
    Anything behind the source offset will be ignored.
  -dstOff <number>: Offset into the destination file. By default is 0. 
  -length <number>: How many bytes of the input should be written. If not
    specified, the whole input will be written into the destination.

mountdisk <disk>: Mounts a virtual disk. On Windows, this command invokes the
  diskpart system utility and requires elevated privileges. 

unmountdisk <disk>: Unmounts a virtual disk. On Windows, this command invokes the
  diskpart system utility and requires elevated privileges.

help: Prints this help text.

[Examples]
# Transpiles myfile.pa into assembly.asm
pasme transpile myfile.pa -to assembly.asm

# Calls the assembler program to generate boot.img binary
pasme assemble assembly.asm -to boot.img

# Overwrites the first 512 bytes of disk.vhd with boot.img
pasme burn boot.img -to disk.vhd -srcOff 0x0 -dstOff 0x0 -length 512
